This suggests that conflict and lack of social acceptance (regardless of gender or religion) are as detrimental to progress as resource scarcity.\n\n\n2. The Environment vs. Development Paradox\n8 out of the bottom 10 countries actually score higher in environmental quality than in basic human needs. This isn’t necessarily a policy choice, but a result of a lack of industrialization; these nations have not yet “developed enough to pollute”.\n\n\n3. The African Context\nThe analysis revealed that 8 out of the bottom 10 countries are Sub-Saharan African. Interestingly, despite high poverty levels, no South Asian countries appeared in the bottom 10, suggesting that social progress is driven by factors beyond just income."
