### Global Social Progress Analysis
**The Challenge:** Moving beyond GDP to analyze how 169 countries translate wealth into quality of life, focusing specifically on the world's most struggling nations.

* **Key Insight:** Analysis revealed that "Social Inclusion" (gender, religion, ethnicity) is the most common weakness in the bottom 10 countries, often outweighing basic needs like food or water.
* **Design Choice:** Utilized a "monochromatic green" palette to focus on growth potential and avoid the judgmental bias of "red = bad".
* **Tech used:** Tableau, Box Plots, Scatter Plot Distributions.
